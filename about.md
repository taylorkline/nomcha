I'm [Taylor Kline](https://www.facebook.com/taylor.kline.me) and I like books, dogs, nice humans, and tasty tea. This blog is a simple journal of teas and showdowns of some of my favorite varieties between different vendors, with a focus on, simply, "Does the tea taste good?" I'm discovering my own preferences and biases through these writings, so feel free to disagree with me if your tastes differ from mine!
